### What I learnedIn 

In this challenge, I learned several valuable things about CSS:

1. The `background` property: This versatile property allows you to apply multiple background images, position values, and other settings all in a single declaration. For example, you can set multiple background images, specify their positioning, and even control the size andrepeat behavior. This can be very powerful for creating complex and visually-interesting backgrounds.
2. The `background-position` property: I gained a deeper understanding of this property, which controls the initial position of a background image. I learned thatit can take various values like keywords (e.g., `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `center`), lengths (e.g., `10px 20px`), or percentages (e.g., `50% 30%`). This allows for precise control overwherethe background image is placed within the element.In this challenge, I learned several valuable things about CSS.
3. Bootstrap card footer styles: I noticed thatinthe Bootstrap CSS file, the `footer` class within a card element has the `last-child` pseudo-class applied. This means thatthe styles will only be applied tothelast child element within the card's footer. This is a common technique used to target specific elements within a complex structure, like a card layout, and apply custom styles.

   Overall, this challenge helped me deepen my understanding of CSS properties and techniques, which will be valuable as I continueto build more complex and visually-appealing web layouts.
