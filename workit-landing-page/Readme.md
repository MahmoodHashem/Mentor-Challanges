## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I discovered clip path

### Continued development

I need to be more cautious with my time estimates! I thought I could finish this in an hour, but it ended up taking nearly fourâ€”mostly due to the curved sections and the layout for the founder section. Lesson learned!

### Useful resources

- [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path) - Creating an ellipse shape that was layered under another div is how I implemented the curves.
