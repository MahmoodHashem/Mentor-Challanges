## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Through this project, I gained substantial experience in DOM manipulation, which involved dynamically altering the HTML and CSS using JavaScript. I learned how to effectively add, remove, and modify attributes within HTML elements, which enabled me to create a more interactive and responsive user interface. Additionally, this project was an excellent opportunity to deepen my understanding of JavaScript event handling and how it integrates with the web page's lifecycle. The hands-on experience was incredibly rewarding and has significantly enhanced my skills in web development. This project was not only educational but also a highly enjoyable experience that has increased my enthusiasm for future projects in this field.


### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me for Errors and some stuck that i had. I really liked this website and will use it going forward.
- [W3School](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This is an amazing learning platform which helped me learn javascript and css more deeply. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
