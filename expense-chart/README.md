## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the bar chart and hover over the individual bars to see the correct amounts for each day
- See the current day’s bar highlighted in a different colour to the other bars
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device’s screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- **Bonus**: Use the JSON data file provided to dynamically size the bars on the chart

## My process

In this challenge, one of the key things I learned was how to create dynamic charts and data visualizations using a combination of CSS and JavaScript.

On the CSS side, I likely explored techniques for building the basic chart structure, such as:

- Using `div` and `span` elements to represent the chart bars, labels, or other visual components.
- Applying styles like `width`, `height`, `background-color`, `border-radius`, etc. to shape and style the chart elements.
- Leveraging CSS positioning and layout properties to arrange the chart components properly.
- Potentially using CSS animations or transitions to add interactivity and transitions to the chart.

Then, on the JavaScript side, I was able to take this static chart structure and make it dynamic by:

- Selecting the relevant chart elements using DOM manipulation methods.
- Updating the styles of these elements programmatically, such as changing the `width` or `height` properties to reflect changing data.
- Potentially hooking into user events like clicks or hovers to trigger more advanced chart interactions.
- Using JavaScript to fetch data from source, and then updating the chart in real-time to visualize the data.

By combining the visual power of CSS and the programmatic capabilities of JavaScript, I was able to create engaging, interactive, and data-driven charts that could be tailored to the specific needs of the project.
