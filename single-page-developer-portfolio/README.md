# Single Page - Developer Portfolio

This is a solution to the [Single-page developer portfolio challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/singlepage-developer-portfolio-bBVj2ZPi-x). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects.

## The Challenge

Users should be able to:

* Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  * Any field is empty
  * The email address is not formatted correctly
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
* **Bonus**: Hook the form up so it sends and stores the user's inquiry (you can use a spreadsheet or Airtable to save the inquiries)
* **Bonus**: Add your own details (image, skills, projects) to replace the ones in the design
