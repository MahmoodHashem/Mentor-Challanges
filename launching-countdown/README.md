## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- See a live countdown timer that ticks down every second (start the count at 14 days)
- **Bonus**: When a number changes, make the card flip from the middle

### What I learned

1. **Implementing Flipping Card Animations:**

   - For the launching countdown project, I needed tocreate a visually striking countdown display with a flipping card effect.
   - This was a challenging task, as I had touse a combination of ` HTML`, `CSS`, and `JavaScript` to achieve the desired animation.
   - Through research and experimentation, I was able to master the techniques for creating the flipping card effect without the use of any external libraries or frameworks.
   - Mastering this animation technique has expanded my understanding of how to create dynamic and engaging user interfaces using core web development technologies.
2. **Leveraging the JavaScript DateObject:**

   - Another key learning from the launching countdown project was a deeper  understanding of the JavaScript Dateobjectand its associated methods.
   - Previously, I had a basic knowledge of the Dateobject, but working on this projectrequired me to explore its more advanced capabilities.
   - I learned how touse methods like `getYear()`, `getTime()`, `getDay()`, and others to precisely calculate and display the remaining timeuntil the countdown reaches zero.
   - Becoming proficient with the Dateobject has equipped me with the skills tobuild complex time-based applications and handle dateandtime-related functionality effectively.

These learnings from the launching countdown project have been invaluable in expanding my web development skills. The ability to create visually striking animations and effectively work with date and time-related data are crucial skills that I can applyto a wide range of future projects. I'm grateful for the opportunity to tackle this challenge and deepen my understanding of these important web development concepts.
