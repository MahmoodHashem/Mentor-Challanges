## Overview

### The Challenge

Users should be able to:

- Fill in the form and see the card details update in real-time
- Receive error messages when the form is submitted if:
  - Any input field is empty
  - The card number, expiry date, or CVC fields are in the wrong format
- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover, active, and focus states for interactive elements on the page

### What I Learned

Through this project, I learned the following key things:

1. How to create a complex layout using positioning techniques
2. The most efficient way to validate a form is by using HTML and JavaScript pre-build validation API
3. The importance of writing clean, maintainable code

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I plan to focus on improving my understanding of accessibility and making sure my projects are inclusive and easy to use for all users.
