## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com) - For styling

### What I learned

 I  gained experience in using Tailwind CSS, which allowed me to create a responsive and visually appealing design quickly. One important aspect was understanding how to ***handle dynamic classes*** and ensuring accessibility standards.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to focus on adding animations to components to enhance user experience. Implementing smooth transitions when users interact with elements will make the application feel more polished.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Documentation](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - A great resource for learning how to use Tailwind effectively.
