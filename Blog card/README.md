## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
    I am thrilled to have had the opportunity to work with Flexbox and item alignment in this project. 


```css
.body {
   display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
  }
```


### Continued development
    In the Future Inshallah I will work on Grid and make dynamic pages with JavaScript
