## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript



### What I learned

This challenge was particularly difficult as it required me to advance my knowledge of CSS Grid, which I managed to learn more about during the process.




### Useful resources

- [Play Grid Attack](https://codingfantasy.com/games/css-grid-attack/play?mode=easy&love=true) - This Game helped me a lot  for learning grid from basic reason. I really liked that, and suggest to everyone who want to learn Grid.
