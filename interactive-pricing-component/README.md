## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to customize range inputs across different browsers.

```css
input[type="range"]::-webkit-slider-runnable-track {}
input[type="range"]::-moz-range-track {}
input[type="range"]::-webkit-slider-thumb{}
input[type="range"]::-moz-range-thumb 
```

### Useful resources

- [Custom Range Input That Looks Consistent Across All Browsers Article](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2021/12/create-custom-range-input-consistent-browsers/) - This helped me learn about different pseudo-classes for input ranges
