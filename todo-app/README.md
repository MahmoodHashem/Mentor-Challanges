## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanila Javascript

### What I learned

1. Browser Local Storage Manipulation:

   - One of the core things I learned was how to effectively use the browser's local storage to persist user data.
   - This allowed me to store task-related information, such as the todo items and their completion statuses, even after the page was refreshed or the browser was closed.
   - Mastering the `localStorage.setItem()`, `localStorage.getItem()`, and `localStorage.removeItem()` methods was crucial for ensuring the todo list maintained its state between user sessions.
2. Drag-and-Drop Functionality:

   - Another key learning experience was implementing a drag-and-drop mechanism for reordering the todo list items.
   - I explored techniques to detect and handle the various drag and drop events, such as `dragstart`, `dragover`, `drop`, and `dragend`.
   - This enabled users to easily reorganize the todo items by simply clicking, dragging, and dropping them into their desired order.
3. DOM Manipulation and Event Handling:

   - A significant part of the challenge involved learning how to effectively manipulate the DOM (Document Object Model) and handle various JavaScript events.
   - For example, I learned how to efficiently target and update specific elements within a container, based on their state (e.g., completed or incomplete tasks).
   - This involved techniques like querying the DOM, attaching event listeners, and dynamically updating the UI to reflect the changes.
4. Filtering and Searching Functionality:

   - Another important aspect I mastered was the ability to filter and search the todo list items based on their completion status.
   - I learned how to implement features that allowed users to view all tasks, only completed tasks, or only incomplete tasks.
   - This required understanding how to effectively process and display the todo list data based on the user's selected filter criteria.
5. Individual Task Deletion:

   - The final key learning point was the implementation of individual task deletion functionality.
   - I explored ways to enable users toremove specific todo items from the list, updating the local storage and the UI accordingly.
   - This involved handling click events ondelete buttons and updating the underlying data structure to reflect the changes.

### Continued development

 Enhancing the User Experience:

- Now that I've established the core functionality of the todo list, I'm interested in finding ways to enhance the user experience.
- This could involve adding smooth animations, implementing keyboard shortcuts, or exploring more intuitive drag-and-drop interactions.
- By focusing on polishing the UI and improving the overall usability, I can create a more engaging and delightful experience for the users.

7. Integrating with Backend Systems:

   - While the current implementation relies on browser local storage, I'm curious about incorporating a backend system to store and manage the todo list data.
   - This could involve integrating with a server-side API, allowing users to access their todo lists across devices and enabling collaboration features.
   - Exploring backend integration would expand my skill setin areas like client-server communication, API design, and database management.
