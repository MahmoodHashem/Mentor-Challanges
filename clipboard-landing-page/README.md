## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/)

### What I learned

Through this project, I gained valuable insights into the benefits of using Tailwind, particularly its utility-first approach and mobile-first design philosophy.

* **Efficiency with Tailwind CSS** : I discovered how Tailwind's utility classes can significantly speed up the development process and enhance productivity.
* **Mobile-First Design Principles** : Understanding the importance of mobile-first design helped me create a more user-friendly interface.
* **CSS Customization** : Tailwind's customization options allowed me to easily implement design variations while maintaining consistency.
