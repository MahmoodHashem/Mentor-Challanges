## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties


### What I learned

In fact the most new things i learned were in css such as aligning, using different ways of colors and border raduis 

CSS
```css
.card {
  /* using border raduis */ 
  border-radius: 10px;
  /* using text align */ 
  text-align: center;
  /* using the rgba of colors  */ 
  box-shadow: 0 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);
}
```


### Continued development

I think in this modul I shoud use flex or grid but I couldn't, So I want to focus on flex and grids, Inshahallah


### Useful resources
