### What I learned

In this challenge, one of the most fascinating things I learned was how to create curved sections on a website using CSS. This involves a clever technique where you:

1. Create a section element for the content you want to have a curved edge.
2. Set the background color of that section to match the color you want the curve to be.
3. Then, you add the curved images which are created with svg before and after the section
